1. What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
It allows them to search for an Artist's top 10 songs in the US region and lets them sample the tracks and add them to their library.

2. What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
staff.washington.edu/mshig19/info343/spotify-challenge

3. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Tabitha Kim, Michael Nguyen

4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
10-12 hours.

5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
I feel like a basic introduction on how to approach learning a new API would have been nice. Most of my time was spent trying to figure out how to call certain data and learn the syntax of the spotify API with angular http calls. I made a breakthrough on how it works but it took me a long time. I wish I could have done some cooler stuff like user authentication so I could add songs to a user's library but did not have the time.
